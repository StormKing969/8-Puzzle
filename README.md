The purpose of this assignment is to write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations)
using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzlem problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer
Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. The goal
is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order.
